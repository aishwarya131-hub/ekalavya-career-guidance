## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.4 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ekalavya-career-guidance
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install root dependencies
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd client
npm install
cd ..
```

### 3. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Database Configuration
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ekalavya

# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# LLM API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
LLM_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo

# Frontend URL
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# CORS Configuration
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Database Setup
Start MongoDB service:
```bash
# For MongoDB installed locally
sudo systemctl start mongod

# Or using Docker
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo
```

### 5. Seed the Database
```bash
npm run seed
```

This will populate the database with:
- 18 sample courses across Science, Commerce, and Arts streams
- 10 sample government colleges
- 3 sample student profiles

### 6. Start the Application

#### Development Mode
```bash
# Start both server and client concurrently
npm run dev

# Or start individually
npm run server    # Backend on port 5000
npm run client    # Frontend on port 3000
```

#### Production Mode
```bash
# Build the frontend
cd client
npm run build
cd ..

# Start the server
npm start
```

## Usage

### 1. Student Registration
- Navigate to the home page
- Click "Get Started" 
- Fill in academic details (name, marks, field of interest)

### 2. Aptitude Quiz
- Complete 8-question aptitude assessment
- Questions evaluate preferences across Science, Commerce, and Arts domains
- Receive normalized aptitude scores and dominant domain

### 3. Get Recommendations
- System processes quiz results with hybrid recommendation engine
- Rule-based filtering identifies eligible courses
- LLM provides personalized reasoning and ranking
- Results include match scores and detailed explanations

### 4. Explore Colleges
- Browse colleges offering recommended courses
- Filter by state, district, college type
- View facilities, contact information, and available courses

## Recommendation Algorithm

### Phase 1: Rule-Based Filtering
- Filter courses by eligibility (marks >= min_marks)
- Match declared interest and dominant domain
- Consider stream alignment

### Phase 2: LLM Personalization
- Input: Student profile + filtered courses
- Process: Generate ranked recommendations with reasoning
- Output: 3-5 courses with match scores and explanations

### Phase 3: Validation & Storage
- Validate LLM output against filtered courses
- Calculate confidence levels
- Store recommendations for tracking

## Error Handling & Validation

- **Input Validation**: Joi schemas for all API endpoints
- **Error Logging**: Structured logging with file output
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to rule-based recommendations if LLM fails
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in timeout and retry logic for LLM calls
- **Data Validation**: MongoDB schema validation and constraints

## Security Features

- **Helmet.js**: Security headers
- **CORS**: Configured cross-origin requests
- **Input Sanitization**: Joi validation and MongoDB sanitization
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data in .env file

## Monitoring & Logging

- **Request Logging**: Morgan middleware for HTTP requests
- **Error Logging**: Custom logger with file output
- **Performance Monitoring**: LLM response time tracking
- **Database Monitoring**: Connection status and query performance

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build Docker images
docker build -t ekalavya-server .
docker build -t ekalavya-client ./client

# Run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

### Environment Variables for Production
```env
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://your-production-db
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-production-api-key
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-domain.com
```
